# bakers_game_easy_solver
This python file gives the solution to the Solitaire game "Bakers Game Easy"

To enter your own board to solve (a default board is provided)
replace the existing cards with the cards on your board using the same notation.
(A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K) for ranks.
(H, D, C, S) for suits.
For example, the 2 of hearts becomes "2H".
The Ace of Spades becomes "AS".
The 10 of Diamonds becomes "TD".
Use the default_board.jpeg as a guide, if needed.

Only boards in their starting state can be solved, so trying a board that has been changed from its initial state will likely not be solved.
